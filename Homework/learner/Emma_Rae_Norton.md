i like to learn with limitations. by limitations i mean shape and by shape i mean boundaries. it is helpful for me to have a pre-existing structure in place before i go down my own path of exploring or creating within a given subject. it has been helpful to me to not consider failure, or learning through doing and then failing. i respond better to learning through doing with the intention of succeeding. however, succeeding does not mean i did a thing and it was perfect or even well-received by my peers. succeeding means through doing i discovered a new question that inspired me to keep learning.

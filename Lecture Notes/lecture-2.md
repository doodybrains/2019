# Lecture 2 - Syllabus


# 1. 
**[Curriculum Review Activity](https://github.com/teachingasart/2019/blob/master/Workshops/curriculumworkshop.md)**

Imagine yourself as a member of the D.O.E., or a school’s board member who would be reviewing curricula. Consider yourself as someone who would be critical of a proposed curricula, specifically attuned to where it would break. Think about questions they may have, such as: How does this curricula enable a path to college acceptance? How does grading work in this curriculum?

In pairs we are going to review one another’s curriculum, providing critical feedback. We will then take time to be critical of our own curricula and revise or propose edits based on your conversations and received feedback.

10 minutes - close reading of your partner's curricula

10 minutes - share constructive criticism and feedback with your partner (each person taking 5 minutes to share with each other)

5 minutes - think about how you would revise your curriculum based on your conversation

Discuss your process with the class

**[Syllabus Workshop](https://github.com/teachingasart/2019/blob/master/Workshops/syllabusworkshop.md)**

Part 1

	1. Itemizing: The first step in syllabus building is itemizing everything you want to cover. Take a few minutes to go on a free association, make a mental map of items which include references, names, contexts, simulations, activities, discrete unit of information.


	2. Listing: Lists everything you want to cover under one layer of hierarchy/categorization. Try to list them in the order of importance. Try to eliminate redundant or less important items. Make at least two iterations of the lists, and see which one works better.


	3. Modularize: Modularizing is a process of grouping by hierarchy - extracting key topics from each module. All of the steps up and including modularizing are geared towards establishing the learning outcomes.
	
Part 2
	
	1. Sequencing:  Sequencing is about breaking up information and key topics over time. It is in step 4 where we begin to think about learning objectives in relations to in class activities and homeworks, etc.

	2. Speed: Speed How do we take into account the global speed of the class at large but also individualized learning speed? Not everyone will learn at the same speed, how can we make the course interesting and challenging while also keeping it accessible for most people? What deadlines and testing can we implement to support a fair speed that benefits all students?

	3. Narrative: Narrative Constructing a narrative around the class includes mapping discrete information and knowledge and key topics and concepts over a learning curve of time + learner. We want to create a syllabus which feels like a script.
	
	4. Correlations: Teaching is never in a vacuum, there are always correlations between other syllabi - the learning is always within a greater context, environment and habitat. Finding correlations is a process of zooming back out to the curriculum to see how this particular syllabus connects with other classes.

**Public Practise, Community**

"Community does not sublate the finitude it exposes. Community itself, in sum, is nothing but this exposition. It is the community of finite begins, and as such it is itself a finite community."


"Community means, consequently, that there is no singular being without another singular being... In place of such a communion, there is communication.
finitude.. it appears, it presents itself, it exploses itself, and thus it exists as communication.
for finitude always presents itself in being-in-common and as this being itself."

– The Inoperative Community, Jean–Luc Nancy, 1985-86


“All art invites social interaction; yet in the case of SEA it is the process itself -- the fabrication of the work -- that is social.”

– Pablo Helguera. Education for Socially Engaged Art

**Assignment for next week**

Design a syllabus for a 6-week long class in 'your high school' about 'care'.

- Read [Art is Medicine](https://www.artforum.com/print/201803/helen-molesworth-on-the-work-of-simone-leigh-74304) article about Simone Leigh. This reading needs to be a central reference for your syllabus on care.


- Contextualize the class within the curriculum you designed last week. Focus on the learning outcomes (tangible takeaways) while thinking about the long term learning objectives.

- The syllabus needs to include a class title, description, and schedule. Please follow the syllabus worksheet

- 500 words & 1 image

- In class next week we will return to our same partners and you will present your syllabus from the perspective of a teacher (or a schoolmaster.) Your partner will give feedback from the perspective of a student and vice versa. After, in partner-pairs, you will discuss your syllabus for the whole class.

**Readings for Next Week**:

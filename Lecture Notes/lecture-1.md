# Lecture 1 - Why Art matters?


Artist presentation by Taeyoon (20 minutes)

Introduction, expectations, schedule.

Expectations for students. You will create material for your workshop. You will try teaching in real life.  

Introduction of students, what are you excited about? Why did you decide to take this class?

# 1.

- Why it's important to think about 'Teaching as Art'?
- The art of teaching and teaching of Art
- Art has a uniquely transformative power
- There's a potency in Art's resistance to utility
- For an educator, there's a lot to learn from Art and Artists

Taeyoon: What is art?

Student: Art is just an act of making something. Artists or audience can bring meaning.

Taeyoon: Is it just an expression?  

Student: I can do whatever and call it Art, if I can explain it.

Taeyoon: You can only get so far. I think Art professionals have a pretty good bullshit filter.  

I agree Art is an expression, but Art is more than just a delivery of expression. Art is a way of finding a meaning.

Art matters because it's very material. Digital art or even Conceptual art has a material impact on how we see and experience the world. Our perceptions change through art.

Art gives a different way of communicating. It's closer to affect compared to language. It's the intensity and transmission, before we recognize what emotion it is. It's prior to taste or 'understanding.'  

Art has a sublime quality which gives a chance to question our being. I have relationships with artworks, and I'm speaking broadly about art, including painting or music, literature or cinema. Each time I see the work, there's something more for me. It gives something new to me. And every time, I change a little bit by experiencing the artwork. It's different from commercials that are designed to give you a feeling, a certain kind of feeling, as an outcome of their material.

Art is often times not useful. It's not meant to be used. Although many forms of art, like what I make or what my friends make, are  effective in everyday situations, sometimes blurring the distinction between design, technology and art. However, as artists, we have a right to make something that does not do stuff. This resistance to utlitarian function, that's where we create a space beyond function. It's not only about making things beautiful or expressing yourself. It's about opening a space where you can be anything, anytime, anywhere.

I take art seriously, almost religiously. Without art, life would be really dull. We have been able to survive without art. There have been times when authoritarian government suppressed art, censored art.  

The art of teaching and the teaching of art are different. I need to talk about Art to talk about teaching.

Teaching as a gift

- What is my teaching philosophy?
- Teaching is an act of generosity. When I give a gift, I'm not expecting anything from you. Gifts are supposed to be a celebration of our relationship.
- Teaching
- Assesment, feedback mechanism, mechanism to understand the work
- Where does the learning stop? Or, what are the obstacles in learning?  
- A classroom in conflict, or finding–creating a learning environment in a site of conflict  


# 3-4.

Student: But a Gift, in sociology, is something people give to each other in hopes of a reward or compensation?

Taeyoon: Gift is different from trade, it's not transactional.  

Teaching and learning can be a reciprocal relationship. Students can inspire the teacher and help the teacher learn.

Student: How about bad teachers? Teachers who approach teaching as a purely professional task?

Good teachers and bad teachers are different. There's a lot to learn from bad teachers. It can be a bad curricular system that makes a bad teacher.

# 5.
Kant's notion of education stresses discipline over creativity.

It feels like much of the public education system enforces discipline to tailor people to fit into society.  

# 6.
Education, in a traditional understanding, is taming the nature into utilitarian purpose. It's like cutting a tree into a log, and then making a pencil from it.

Learning is about learning to learn. You may remember learning to ride a bicycle. Verbal instructions offer little help. You need to ride the bicycle and fall a few times, learn to take risks, each time balancing your movement.

Student: "especially after No Child Left Behind."

Taeyoon: "Can you elaborate?"

Student elaborates

# 7.


"In learning an action, instead of having it given ready-made, one of necessity learns to vary its factors, to make varied combinations of them, according to change of circumstances. A possibility of continuing progress is opened up by the fact that in learning one act, methods are developed good for use in other situations. Still more important is the fact that the human being acquires a habit of learning. He learns to learn."
– [Democracy and Education](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/852/852-h/852-h.htm) by John Dewey


# 8.

Teaching is about lifting up the students. It's giving a chance to see beyond the fence.

I was thinking about "what you want to learn, how you want to learn" When I was preparing this class.

# 9.

Teaching as learning

The secret of teaching effectively is to think from the perspective of someone who is learning

# 10.
Teacher and Student. Being a teacher and student is like playing a game of musical chairs. The player's roles may rotate. It's a play as in the 'appropriation of power'.


# 14-17.

Anni Albers is a very important figure. Unfortuantely, because history was written by men about men, she's often introduced as the wife of Josef Albers. While Josef is also important, he set the academic rigor and research of formal qualities and color, Anni contributed to the teaching philosophy and curriculum. I think of her as the archetypical coder and designer. Her textile works as well as prints show the systemic approach to patterns and abstraction.

– [Handweaving Today: Textile Work at Black Mountain College](http://www.albersfoundation.org/teaching/anni-albers/texts/#) by Anni Albers

# 18-19.

Anni Alber's approach is radical, because she focuses on the materiality of textile as a starting point for design. It's not relying on a dream of what the work is going to be, but emerges in the material and lets the form emerge out of the process.


Student: Is this similar to The Logic of Sense, a book by Gilles Deleuze?

Taeyoon: Could you elaborate?


/details to work on. Deleuze's notion of the painter coming with many ideas about what the painting can be, and subtracting it to give form...


# 21.

Drawing of my desk. I read, write and eat there. I have some knowledge, opinions and experiences that don't mean much on its own.

One option is to organize them on a shelf. It's neat. Another option is to distill the all of it into a book. This process is like fabricating knowledge into a new material.

– The Experimenters, Chance and design at Black Mountain College, Eva Díaz, 2015

Experimenter  

"To Fuller, investigational prototyping was inextricably part of any experimental method—“I designed this thing so it would deliberately fall down, would not stand.” As disorderly as the process of constructing the dome may
have appeared to participants—wet Venetian blinds scattered throughout the landscape of Black Mountain’s Lake Eden campus—the dome was, according to him, engineered and “measured by comprehensive and strict practices of calculation and test.” Fuller wanted students to think structurally about buildings,
questioning underlying engineering principles without accepting formal architectural conventions. He excoriated the way most art and architecture programs “teach otherwise innocent students to make pathetic attempts to out-Mies Mies while overlooking the energetic and economic fundamentals governing development of truly evolutionary design initiative, and design responsibility.” – [The Experimenters, Chance and design at Black Mountain College](http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/E/bo18291671.html) by Eva Díaz

# 23-26.
Buckminster Fuller, an eccentric futurist

Utopia, utilitiy, futility, Industrialism.

Institute of Design, Chicago

The trouble between Fuller and Kenneth Snelson, Fuller's student who was upset about a credit to his invention and contribution.

# 27.
Constructivist Theory of Learning, simply put is learning by doing and making.  


# 28.

1. One dot is just information.

2. There are two dots, you made a connection between two pieces of information.

3. You make more connections between them, it becomes knowledge.

4. By now, you've created as association of knowledge, which you can reshape.

5. Now you've abstracted the assiciation of knowledge, emotion, and memories.

Learning is like connecting lots of sensory data and the abstracted associations, and building a world with it.

# 30-31.

Learning is building a habit. People learn by making muscle memory of doing something, repetition is important, necessary.

Teaching is making a habitat, an environment where one can build the habit.

In the comic, I illustrate the theory of creating a habitat literally. The dots and lines become a tent, in which a person can sleep.

“authentic education is not carried on by “A” for “B” or by “A” about “B,” but rather by “A” with “B." – Pedagogy of the Oppressed by Paolo Freire, pg 93, [Problem-posing education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem-posing_education)


# 33. 

Words coming up in the horizon.

* Care 
* Maintenance
* Attention 
* Assembly
* Potentiality 
* Constructivism 





### Activity

- Blocks and connections
- Remember the time you learned something

### Assignment

- Mapping my learning (how do I learn something?)
- It's like a manual for your learning. Manual for someone to teach you.


# Lecture 2 - Curriculum

I will dedicate this lecture to Suzanne Lacy, an unofficial professor for the marginalized communities. 
 

Key concepts in curriculum

- Education's objective and outcome 
- Relationship between the classes 
- Tree structure in schools 
- In class activity: High School, Sophomore year 
- Limits of horizontal education 
- Semillatice of learning: habitat  

Key concepts in art as curriculum 

- Performance art 
- Social practice, Socially engaged art
- Community art 
- Interventionist / Tactical media 
- Feminism 
- Activism 
- Body politics 

Topics 

- Community is a curriculum
- Body is a curriculum 
- Space is a curriculum
- Street is a curriculum
- Food is a curriculum


## 1. What is Curriculum?

- Latin (curre):  
	-  run   
	-  hurry, hasten, speed
	-  move, travel, proceed
- How is it different from a syllabus? 
- Curriculum is the reason for architecture. Syllabus is the blueprint for an architecture. Pedagogy is the use of an architecture. Together, three pillars of teaching create a habitat for learning, space for personal growth and advancement of knowledge. 
-  Curriculum is global – often times designed by the school or the government. Syllabus is local – executed by the teacher.
- Traditional curriculum: what you will learn in a class, over a semester, an academic year, or degree?  
- What the student will achieve through participating in the class? 
- A journey's direction  

**Learning outcomes and Learning objectives**  

- Learning objectives are tangible deliverables, defined expectations and goals in the form of skills, assignments, tests, degree. 

- Learning outcomes reflect what the learner will be able to do as a result of participating in the educational activities. It is a conceptual measure within a greater curriculum and habitat of learning. 

	- Learning outcomes are an explicit transfer of knowledge and skills (obtaining skills, sowing the seeds), Learning outcomes are an implicit transformation of knowledge (harvesting for the season)

**Curriculum & Studies, Dewey**  

The counterpart of the isolation of mind from activities dealing with objects to accomplish ends is isolation of the subject matter to be learned. In the traditional schemes of education, subject matter means so much material to be studied. Various branches of study represent so many independent branches, each having its principles of arrangement complete within itself. History is one such group of facts; algebra another; geography another, and so on till we have run through the entire curriculum. Having a ready-made existence on their own account, their relation to mind is exhausted in what they furnish it to acquire. This idea corresponds to the conventional practice in which the program of school work, for the day, month, and successive years, consists of "studies" all marked off from one another, and each supposed to be complete by itself—for educational purposes at least. (John Dewey)


The scheme of a curriculum must take account of the adaptation of studies to the needs of the existing community life; it must select with the intention of improving the life we live in common so that the future shall be better than the past. Moreover, the curriculum must be planned with reference to placing essentials first, and refinements second. The things which are socially most fundamental, that is, which have to do with the experiences in which the widest groups share, are the essentials. The things which represent the needs of specialized groups and technical pursuits are secondary. There is truth in the saying that education must first be human and only after that professional. But those who utter the saying frequently have in mind in the term human only a highly specialized class: the class of learned men who preserve the classic traditions of the past. They forget that material is humanized in the degree in which it connects with the common interests of men as men. Democratic society is peculiarly dependent for its maintenance upon the use in forming a course of study of criteria which are broadly human. Democracy cannot flourish where the chief influences in selecting subject matter of instruction are utilitarian ends narrowly conceived for the masses, and, for the higher education of the few, the traditions of a specialized cultivated class. The notion that the "essentials" of elementary education are the three R's mechanically treated, is based upon ignorance of the essentials needed for realization of democratic ideals. Unconsciously it assumes that these ideals are unrealizable; it assumes that in the future, as in the past, getting a livelihood, "making a living," must signify for most men and women doing things which are not significant, freely chosen, and ennobling to those who do them; doing things which serve ends unrecognized by those engaged in them, carried on under the direction of others for the sake of pecuniary reward. For preparation of large numbers for a life of this sort, and only for this purpose, are mechanical efficiency in reading, writing, spelling and figuring, together with attainment of a certain amount of muscular dexterity, "essentials." Such conditions also infect the education called liberal, with illiberality. They imply a somewhat parasitic cultivation bought at the expense of not having the enlightenment and discipline which come from concern with the deepest problems of common humanity. *A curriculum which acknowledges the social responsibilities of education must present situations where problems are relevant to the problems of living together, and where observation and information are calculated to develop social insight and interest.*
 
## 2. Architecture as Metaphor - Kojin Karatani 


**Tree & Semilattice**  

- The natural city and the artificial city - the tree & the semilattice

	- A semilattice form forms when two or more units overlap, and the overlapping area it itself a recognizable entity and hence a unit as well. 

- Berkeley street corner demonstrates the semilattice structure of a natural city: "When these three elements are combined they begin to function differently. Through human use these emsembles form a unit of the city"

*"The city derives its coherence as a unit both from the forces which hold its own elements together, and from the dynamic coherence of the larger living system.*

Semilattice structure as a learning habitat - takes into account the human interactions, the informal modes of learning, the extra-curricular, the overlaps. 

**Semilattice & Tree in Learning** 

- The tree represents stratified forms of knowledge; lessons, tests, skills, formal courses, the tangible deliverables. 

- The semilattice represents a learning habitat; takes into account the informal ways of learning and the extra-curricular. 

A curriculum contains both a formal system system and an informal system, the tree + the the semilattice

- Architecture which, guided through its blueprints, allows for the interactions of the living space of the environment. 

- Habitat of learning exists between the formal architecture of schools and the living space of life. 
  
## 3. In Class Activity   

Reflecting on the curriculums we have participated in and our habitats of learning, identifying the connections, disconnects and gaps in our curricular structure. 

Ask students: 
1. Recall back to your sophomore year in High School.
2. What were the classes you took?
3. Write down these classes and think about the ways in which they related to one another, focusing on the curriculum. 
4. What were the learning outcomes and learning objectives of this curriculum at large? 
5. Was the curriculum experience more similar to the tree structure or the semilattice? Why and in what ways?
6. Did this curriculum form a part of a larger habitat of learning? Why or why not? 


## 4. Curriculum as an art practice

## 5. The Meaning of Community
- The finitude, the visible limit of a program, duration of a project 
- Liberation from permanence, temporality as essentially a community 
- things that are traditionally considered 'extra-curricular' 
- "Community does not sublate the finitude it exposes. Community itself, in sum, is nothing but this exposition. It is the community of finite begins, and as such it is itself a *finite* community."
- "Community means, consequently, that there is no singula being without another singular being: p.28 
- "In place of such a communion, there is communication. finitude.. it appears, it presents itself, it exploses itself, and thus it exists as communication. ... finite being always presents itself "together," hence severally, for finitude always presents itself in being-in-common and as this being itself," p.28.

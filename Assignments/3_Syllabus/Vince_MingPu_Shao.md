![hierarchy of topics to care](https://wp.nyu.edu/vinceshao/wp-content/uploads/sites/12235/2019/02/hierarchy.jpg)

#### Context

*The class is implemented in the first year of the high school I created, which contains other major courses. It's a 6-week long class with only 2 to 3 classes scheduled per week. There's no homeworks, tests or any kind of pressure outside of the class.*

## Introduction

Care is a broad and huge topic to talk about. However, learning the word `care` as either a noun or verb is an inevitable and constant task for each one of us has. The thing we think and care about could be as wide as the entire world and environment, but also as intimate as family and ourselves. We do care a lot, but why do we care about these things, and why do we have to care? Furthermore, should we learn to care about more and how to care? Let's find out the answers in this 6-week long class.

### 1. Empathy 
  
  - **Duration**: 3 weeks
  - **Description**: Before we care, we need to know empathy. Without empathy, the action of caring would be shallow, even making things worse. We'll first attempt to understand empathy, hence care, through two different aspects: inquiry and imagination.
    - Inquiry: The ability to be a listener who spots problems and asks right question is vital. In this topic, we'll learn the stories and knowledge of self/others/environment/world, and how to learn more information.
    - Imagination: We attempt to put ourselves into others shoes to experience distinct situations. 
    
#### W1: Topics of care in pop movie, music and and comics
We'll enjoy and discuss some great stories about care told by pop-culture media, and try to understand why the artists/creatives want to talk about these stories.

#### W2: Put in ___'s shoes
Moving in wheel chair, texting without using fingers and more.

#### W3: Politics: news reading and discussion    
Countless things that worth our attention and care are happening out there each moments. We learn to find, read and relate to topics we care about.
  
#### 2. Care

  - **Duration**: 3 weeks
  - **Description**: After we know how to be empathetic, we can attempt to perform actions of care. In this process, we'll ask questions of why, what and how.
    - Why do we care? Learn the correlation between self/others and self.
    - What to care? Exploration of self, others, environmental and world.
    - How to care? Communication skills and participation of affairs. 
    
#### W4: The correlated web and traces between everything
Have you ever try to understand the complicated layers, connections traces of something? We'll find that things seem unrelated to us actually affect our life in various ways. 

#### W5: Exploration: caring week
Try to focus on one topic or target to care for an entire week.

#### W6: Let's talk about how text and behavior make you feel  
We've been hurt and hurt others with our behaviors and words. Let's put these things making you uncomfortable into light and talk about it.

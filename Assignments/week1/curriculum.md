# Context

Below curriculum is designed for sophomore year high school students.

# Structure

Students have the liberty to choose 6 subjects among the provided selection of subject at the school. Please refer to the [List of Subjects](#list-of-subjects) section in this document below for the complete list of subjects that you can choose from. By allowing students to make their own selection of subjects to take, students will learn how to make their own choices and take charge of their own educational path.

Students are also asked to pick one subject within their selection as their primary subject of interest. Students with same subject of interest meet together on a weekly basis with the subject's adivising teacher to discuss more in-depth and real life and outside of textbook materials of the subject. Students are also asked to devise and execute a semester long personal research about a topic of their choice in the field of study, with the help of their advising teacher, for the fall semester. The deliverables differ depending on the subject.

In the spring semester, students are asked to collaborate with a student with a different primary subject. This collaboration will happen under a closer guidance of a advising teacher who will attend to the needs of the students and their project with specific needs of the proposed project. 

At the end of each semester, students have an opportunity to present on their semester-long personal researches / collaborative projects.

In addition to student's selection of subjects, all students are required to take one session of Physical Education and Assembly. They are also required to choose an extracurricular activity of their choice, which is scheduled for a duration of two sessions per week. Lastly, at the beginning and end of each day, students will attend homeroom with their homeroom teachers.

Students are expected to have sessions where they are not required to go into a class. At these times, they are expected to use the time at their own disgression to do assignments for their classes or to continue their personal researches. Any of the common spaces such as student lounges, library, cafeteria or outdoor campus grounds are always open for students to use at any given time during school hours.

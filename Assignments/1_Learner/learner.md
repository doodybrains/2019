I take a top-down approach to learning. What I mean by this is, I tend to go from the more overall and broader concept of the new topic matter that I am trying to familiarize myself with, then to more fine details of different aspects that comprise the whole.

First, I need a definition. I need to know what it means, a one-line summary of what it is in the eyes of someone else, who hopefully have a quite extensive knowledge of the subject. If the definition is difficult to understand, or if I can’t relate to it, then I would move on to see what someone else has defined it as.

Next I will try to find out what the context of the subject matter is. When was this term first mentioned? Who came up with it? In what field of study is it part of? Are there any preceding theories about it? What progressed from it? Not all of my questions about where this particular topic lies in the broad spectrum of things may be answered. Sometimes I may be familiar with things that come up as I research into the context, but most of the time, this stage of learning leads to more learning about other things that are linked to the original starting subject matter.

Once I have an adequate amount of knowledge gathered through this “background” research, I would turn my focus back to the main subject. What are the significant traits that comprise the workings of it? What constitutes an instance of it to be defined as such? How does this work? As I take the deep dive into the topic itself, I feel as if I am gaining one puzzle piece at a time and the more puzzle pieces that I acquire, the more clear of a picture I gain.

With enough puzzle pieces, I can call this topic to be a part of my network of knowledge. They connect with different nodes of topics and together they form a spider-web of networked knowledge.

Repeat for another instance of learning.

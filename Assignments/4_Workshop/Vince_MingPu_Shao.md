## Description

Typography and grid system is the most elementary yet crucial and difficult part of graphic design. It can affect the sales of a product, an election’s outcome, and even life. For objects like the national identification card, driver’s license or tickets produced by the public sector, the role of typography should gain more attention from the government, designer and people.

It's not a big deal if we're only dealing with flyers or product catalogs. But facing with case carrying identity or critical information, in addition to creating visual hierarchy highlighting key points, a well-designed graphic work must show its willingness to accommodate diversity instead of createing a layout that only suit the majorities. The diverse information here could be names longer than the regular length on ID card, addresses longer than 30 words on driver’s license, or additional information on train tickets. A result of badly designed grid system is a tyranny of the majority layout, which violently and disrespectfully forces minorities to change.

A good designer who cares about every user would take time to review every possible variation of the content meticulously, and design a proper grid system with decent typesettings to accommodate all distinctions accordingly. That attentiveness to details is essential to do great designs, which could provide comfortable user experience with legible paragraphs, readable sign system or fluid responsive web. In the case of an ID card design, this attentiveness could allow the government to provide people with a sense of belonging and assurance of respect to every individual.

In this one-hour workshop, we'll first look at some design cases about grid system and have a discussion about our relationship with which. Following is a brief tutorial of grid system design workflow and techniques in Adobe Illustrator. Finally, we practice redesigning a grid system of one graphic object you get using Illustrator and showcase it.

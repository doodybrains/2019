# 2019
# Teaching as Art

A graduate level course offered at NYU ITP in Spring 2019

Saturdays 12:00 ~ 4:25pm 
ITP Room 50

Professor: [Taeyoon Choi](http://taeyoonchoi.com) trc6@nyu.edu
 
This class is for artists and creative technologists who want to teach. A good teacher is also a great student themself. They transform their curiosity into knowledge and share their learning processes with others. One can learn to become a better teacher by staying fearless about ‘not knowing’ something, embracing radically open ideas and connecting various expertise and knowledge. Teaching can be a form of artistic and creative practice in collaboration with a diverse community. Teachers can invent new forms of learning spaces, new kinds of collaboration and new senses of community.

In this class, students will learn about applying creative processes to teaching. Students will read about the history of artists in and out of academic institutions, Black Mountain College, as well as more recent experiments. Students are expected to engage in critical discussions about the topics.
